# Standing Desk

This github project provides the design document for a cantilevered computer support for a standing desk. It is organised in 3 parts:
* doc: contains a PDF describing the mathematics behind the standing desk design: https://github.com/cedricpradalier/standing-desk/blob/main/doc/support.pdf

* cad: provides an OpenSCAD design file to generate a 3D model of the design, prepare 3D prints or get the dimensions for other design parameters (the maths are the one described in the PDF, so there is no absolute need fro the OpenSCAD file).
